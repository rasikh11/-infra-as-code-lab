## Terraform drift detection

Terraform drift detection is a process that identifies changes to infrastructure outside of Terraform management. This ensures infrastructure  configuration remanins consistent with the desired state defined in Terraform configuration files.


## Why Drift Detection?

1. Unintended changes: Detect manual changes or updates made outside Terraform.

2. Configuration drift: Indentify deviations from desired infrastructure state.
