## Ways to secure Terraform

There are few ways to manage sensitive information in Terraform files. Here're some of most common methods:


##  Use the sensitive attribute

- Terraform provides a sensitive attribute that can be used to mark variables and output variables as sensitive. When a variable or output is marked as sensitive, Terraform will not print its value in the console output or in the state file.


## Secret management system

- Store sensitive data in a secret management system, A secret management system is a dedicated system for storing sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, and SSH keys. Terraform can be configured to read secrets from secret management system, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS secret Manager. 

## Remote Backend

- The terraform state file can be encrypted to protect sensitive data. This can be done by using a secure remote backend, such as Terraform cloud or S3.

## Environment Variables

- Use environment variables. Sensitive data can also be stored in environment variables. Terraform can read environment variables when it is run.

Here're some specific examples of how to use these methods:

Here are some specific examples of how to use these methods:

to mark a variable as sensitive, you would add the sensitive attribute to the variable declaration.

For Example:

variable "aws_access_key_id" {
	sensitive = true
}

To store sensitive data in a secret management system, you would first create a secret in the secret management system. Then you would configure Terraform to read the secret from the secret management system.

For example, to read a secret from HashiCorp Vault, you would use the `vault_generic_secret` data source.

data "vault_generic_secret" "aws_access_key_id" {
	path = "secret/aws/access_key_id"
}

To encrypt the Terraform state file. you would first configure a secure remote backend for state file. Then, you would encrypt the state file using the `terraform encryp` command.

`terraform encrypt`

To use environment variables, you would first define the environment variables in your OS. Then, you configure Terraform Terraform to read the environment variables when it it run.

For example, to define an environment variable called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` you would use the following command:

`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

Then, you would configure Terraform to read the environment variable by adding the following line to youe Terraform configuration file:

```hcl
variable "aws_access_key_id" {
	source = "env://AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
}
