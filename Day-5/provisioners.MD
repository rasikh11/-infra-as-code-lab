Certainly, let's delve deeper into the `file`, `remote-exec`, and `local-exec` provisioners in Terraform, along with examples for each.

1. **File provisioner:** The `file` provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the local machine to remote machine. This is useful for deploying configuration files, scripts, or other assets to provisioned instance. 

Example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
	ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

provisioner "file" {
	source = "/local/path/to/localfile.txt"
	destination = "/path/on/remote/instance/file.txt"
	connection {
		type = "ssh"
		user = "ec2-user"
		private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
 }
}

```
In this example, the `file` provisioner copies the `localfile.txt` from the local machine to the `/path/on/remote/instance/file.txt` location on the AWS Ec2 instance using the ssh connection

2. **remote-exec provisioner:** The `remote-exec` provisioner is used to run scripts or commnads on a remote machine over ssh or WinRm connections. It's used to configure or install software packages on provisioned instances.

Example:

```hcl

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
	ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

provisioner "remote-exec" {
	inline = [
	 "sudo yum update -y",
	 "sudo yum install -y httpd-*",
	 "sudo systemctl start httpd",
	]

	connection {
	 type = "ssh"
	 user  = "ec2-user"
	 private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
	 host = "aws_intance.example.public_ip"
  }
}
```
In this example, the `renote-exec` provisioner connects to the AWS EC2 instance using SSH and runs a series of commands to update the package repositories, install Apache HTTP Server, and start the HTTP Server.

3. **local-exec:** The `local-exec` provisioner is used to run scripts or commands locally on the machine  where Terraform is executed. It's useful for tasks that do not require remote execution, such as initializing a local database or configuring local resources.

Example:

```hcl

resource "null_resource" "example" {
	triggers = {
	 always_run = "${timestamp()}"

 }

provisioner "local-exec" {
	commad = "echo 'This is  a local command'"
  }
}
```
In this example, a `null_resource` is used  with a `local-exec` provisioner to run a  simple local command that echoes a message to the console, whenever Terraform is applied or refreshed. The `timestamp()` function ensures it runs each time.
